title: "Note on EA river restrictions"
---

Some of the events listed in these pages will have river restrictions in place. A river restriction is granted by the EA and gives permission to hold up river traffic for a short period of time. Marshalls ensure a clear navigation channel to other users *e.g.* in between divisions. 

It is NOT the same as a closure, which are much more difficult and expensive to arrange.
