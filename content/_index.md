## Past events

Some of these event will have river restrictions in place. A river restriction is granted by the EA and gives permission to hold up river traffic for a short period of time (and officals when marshalling ensure a clear navigation channel to other users). You can see the latest Thames river restriction and closures here: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/river-thames-conditions-closures-restrictions-and-lock-closures
