# isis-calendar

A _very_ simple Hugo-powered site that keeps all the info about what's happening on the Thames. 

To get something added or for corrections to the content please open a PR or email frcc.harbourmaster@gmail.com

## Running locally

You'll need both `golang` and `Hugo` installed:

* [Install `go`](https://golang.org/)
* [Install `Hugo`](https://gohugo.io/)

Check that it all works by doing 
```bash
hugo version
```

Clone this repo, navigate to the top of the folder and do
```bash
hugo server -D
```
You can then see the site on `localhost` - the prompt will tell you which port.
